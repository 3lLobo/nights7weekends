# Nights&Weekendsâœ¨ðŸŒ™

Looks like my github-page styling finnaly paid off and I got accepted to this mentorship program by [buildspace](https://buildspace.so/).
They have hard deadlines and I'm expected to deliver weekly, thus here we are.

A page to report malicious IP's. I know, kinda lame - it was more to practice wallet authentication and moving on I plan to use the mentoring for the ETHGlobal hacqathon.
